## Introduction

SpikACom is a neuromorphic computing framework designed to enable energy-efficient and adaptive communication by leveraging spiking neural networks (SNNs). This repository provides the simulation code used in our paper to evaluate the performance of SpikACom in three representative communication scenarios, including task-oriented semantic communications, MIMO beamforming, and OFDM channel estimation.

## Dependencies

The code has been tested in the following environment:

- **Python** = 3.10.13
- **SpikingJelly** = 0.0.0.0.14
- **NumPy** = 1.24.3
- **SciPy** = 1.15.1
- **h5py** = 3.5.0

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install spikingjelly==0.0.0.0.14 numpy==1.24.3 scipy==1.15.1 h5py==3.5.0
```
Or create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
pip install spikingjelly==0.0.0.0.14 numpy==1.24.3 scipy==1.15.1 h5py==3.5.0
```
